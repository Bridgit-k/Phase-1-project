AVIATION ACCIDENTS DATA ANALYSIS. 

In this project, I am supposed to come up with recommedations for my company that want to expand into new industries to diversify their portfolio. This company is currently interested in purchasing and operating airplanes fpr commercial and private entreprises. 

The data set that I am using is from the National Transportation Safety Board and its about aviations accidents from 1962 to 2023 in the united states and International waters. 
This data set will help me advise them batter once i learn about the risks and their frequenct of occurence.

To do this, i first extracted information from the data set like the number of columns, the data types of the columns, the missing values and more. 
From this information, I was able to manipulate and clean the data by filling in missing values, dropping unnecessary columns and converting one data type to another. 

Later on, from the clean version of the data type, i was able to come up with visualizations that helped me come up with valid conclusions from the data set like for example, airplanes with more numbers of engines tend to get into more accidents so they should buy airplanes with at most two engines. 

I also came up with a tableau dashboard which is accesible hear:https://public.tableau.com/authoring/Aviationdata_17594982465850/AviationDataAnalysis#1
