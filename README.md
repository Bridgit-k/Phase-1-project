AVIATION ACCIDENTS DATA ANALYSIS.
#About Project#
In this project, I am supposed to analyse a data set which i got from the National Transportation Safety Board, and come up with valid recommendation from the data set for a certain company that wants to expand their business into purchasing and operating aircrafts for diversity in thier business
##Data Analysis and Manipulation##
First, i ipmorted the different libraries and read the csv data set into vs code.
Then, i got the information that I needed about the data set in order to manipulate it by using methods like: .info(), .shape, .head()
Then, I checked the missing values. 
Then i checked the data types of all the columns so as to fill or drop the missing values accordingly.
I dropped the columns that had a lot of missing values and filled the rest accoring to the type of data type. 
I then changed the date data types from object to datetime
##Data Visualization##
After cleaning the dat, i then used it to come up with different visualization so as to come up with appropriate conclusions and recommendations.
